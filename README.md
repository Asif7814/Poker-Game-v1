# Poker Game v1

This is a program which simulates a Poker Game between two players. It displays two hands (one for each player), displays the hand type for each player, determines the results of the game (who has the higher hand) and displays the results in a leaderboard type style.

Version 1 of this project is used through the terminal.

Worked on through April 23, 2023 - April 27, 2023.
